                    <p> Before traveling to Sri Lanka I had no idea what type of foods would be available. I naively assumed that it would be the exact same as Indian food. Although curry, rotti and poppadums are readily available, similar to India, there are so many other foods you must eat in Sri Lanka. 
                        For me, one of the best parts about traveling is sampling the local cuisine in order to get a sense of the native culture and way of life. Not to mention, the food is often amazing!

                        Plantations were terraced into the mountainsides, factories and rudimentary accommodations built for pickers, and a rail network engineered to transport leaves down to Colombo. 
                        The stretch of line between Kandy and Ella is considered one of the most beautiful in the world.

                    <p>Virtual reality refers to interactive images or videos which enable the viewer to explore the entire 360 degrees of a scene. 
                        Unlike a regular image of video, which is shot from a fixed view point, VR production captures every part of a location.
                        In the travel industry, virtual reality can be used to capture tourism destinations in a unique and immersive way.

                    <p> Digital heritage is made up of computer-based materials of enduring value that should be kept for future generations. Digital heritage emanates from different communities, industries, sectors and regions. 
                        Not all digital materials are of enduring value, but those that are require active preservation approaches if continuity of digital heritage is to be maintained.

                    <p> Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that simulates a computer-generated environment and makes it possible to interact with it in a very realistic way. 
                        It has become increasingly popular in recent years, with applications in fields such as gaming, education, healthcare, and entertainment.

                    <p> A 360-degree video is a recording that captures a full spherical view of a scene, allowing viewers to look in any direction—up, down, left, right, or behind—during playback. 
                        It is created using cameras with multiple lenses or an array of synchronized cameras that capture overlapping fields of view.
